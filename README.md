# Attendance Made Easy | Python | QR | py-qr-attendance
## Aim: This project aims to use technology to the fullest to make it ease and to reduce the errors in the process of "Attendance".

### Technologies Used: Python, openCV, QR(Quick Response Code), Google Sheets and Google Drive APIs

Step 1: We generate QR codes using the Excel sheet (from local storage, which has ID and email of candidate), which decodes to be their ID.
The generated QR codes will be mailed to the respective candidate.

Step 2: We run our 2nd program to take input via camera (opencv), and ask the students to show their qr codes to the camera. When a valid input is detected, a beeb sound comes, in the backend, we append the data we get into a temporary list.

Step 3: After all students show their codes, we process the list and add attendance to an online spreadsheet.
